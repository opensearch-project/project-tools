## OpenSearch Project Tools

[![Tests](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-tools/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-tools/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/opensearch-project/project-tools/branch/main/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/opensearch-project/project-tools)

Tools to gather stats on a GitHub organization.

### Usage

#### Global Options

##### Tokens

Set `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` to a personal access token (PAT) or with `--token` to avoid running into too many rate-limit requests as authenticated requests get a higher rate limit. See [GitHub rate limiting](https://docs.github.com/rest/overview/resources-in-the-rest-api#rate-limiting) for more information.

##### Quiet

Use `-q` or `--quiet` to remove progress bars.

##### Caching

The tool will cache data into `.cache` by default for all GitHub API queries to avoid making duplicate requests. To disable caching use `--no-cache`. Run with `--debug` to display cache hits and misses.

##### Debug Logging

Use `-d` or `--debug` to get cache logging and full stack traces if a command fails.

#### Org Info

```
./bin/project org info

url: https://api.github.com/orgs/opensearch-project
repos: 78
```

You can specify a GitHub org name for all commands, including `org info`.

```
./bin/project org info --org=aws
```

#### Org Members

Shows the difference between org members and member data.

```
./bin/project org members
```

#### Sorted List of Repos

```
./bin/project repos list
```

#### Org Teams

Shows org team memberships. Requires a `repo:admin` read-only PAT token.

```
./bin/project org teams
```

#### Maintainers

Shows maintainer stats.

```
./bin/project maintainers stats
```

Shows missing MAINTAINERS.md.

```
./bin/project maintainers missing
```

Audits maintainer lists for maintainers that have 0 commits on a project.

```
./bin/project maintainers audit
```

Review maintainer contents, permissions, and CODEOWNERS.

```
./bin/project maintainers permissions
```

#### Contributor Stats

Shows most frequent contributors bucketed by members, contractors, and external.

```
./bin/project contributors stats

total = 5
members (2):
 https://github.com/dlvenable: 12
 https://github.com/zelinh: 10
contractors (3):
 https://github.com/...: 4
```

By default returns stats for the last full week. Specify `from` and `to` for different dates.

```
./bin/project contributors stats --from=2022-10-02 --to=2022-10-03
```

You can specify relative dates.

```
./bin/project contributors stats --from="last monday" --to="today"
```

For large organizations the default paging interval of 7 days may be too big and fail with `error: There are 1000+ PRs returned from a single query for 7 day(s), reduce --page.`. Decrease the page size.

```
./bin/project contributors stats --org=aws --page 3
```

#### Contributor Lists

Lists human contributors.

```
./bin/project contributors list

saratvemulapalli
sbcd90
...
```

Specify org and repo.

```
./bin/project contributors list --repo=aws-cli --org=aws
```

Specify multiple repos.

```
./bin/project contributors list --org=aws --repo=aws-cli --repo=deep-learning-containers
```

#### Pull Requests

Show a list of pull requests.

```
./bin/project prs list --org=aws --repo=aws-cli
```

#### Pull Request Stats

Shows bucketed contributions.

```
./bin/project prs stats

Between 2022-10-03 and 2022-10-09, 5% of contributions (18/346) were made by 9 external contributors (9/102).

members: 69%
external: 5%
contractors: 8%

https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website/pull/1024: add tracetest as a partner - [@mathnogueira]
https://github.com/opensearch-project/project-website/pull/1023: Add Hyland as partner - [@aborroy]
https://github.com/opensearch-project/opensearch-php/pull/85: Unset port for SigV4Handler, fixes #84 - [@shyim]
...
```

By default returns stats for the last full week. Specify `from` and `to` for different dates.

If the tool sees a new contributor, it will direct you to add aliases into [data/members.txt](data/members.txt), [data/contractors.txt](data/contractors.txt), or [data/external.txt](data/external.txt) and open a browser page for each user so you can examine their account (specify `--ignore-unknown` to disable this behavior). Otherwise, it will output PRs and stats made by external contributors. The easiest way to lookup whether an account belongs to the org is with `./bin/project org members`. Commit and PR your changes to the data lists.

Get the stats since the beginning of year till today.

```
./bin/project prs stats --from=2022-01-01 --to=today
```

Get the stats for a given repo for last week.

```
./bin/project prs stats --org=aws --repo aws-cli
```

Get the stats for multiple repos.

```
./bin/project prs stats --org=aws --repo=aws-cli --repo=deep-learning-containers
```

Get the stats for an entire org and several repos.

```
./bin/project prs stats --org=opensearch-project --repo=aws/aws-cli --repo=aws/deep-learning-containers
```

Get the stats for unmerged (open and closed without being merged) PRs.

```
./bin/project prs stats --status=unmerged
```

#### Issues

Shows issues bucketed by label.

```
./bin/project issues labels

enhancement: 54
untriaged: 43
bug: 36
security vulnerability: 19
