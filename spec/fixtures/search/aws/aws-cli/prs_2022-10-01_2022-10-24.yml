        retrieving metadata and tags, the subscribers were using the intended transfer
        client instead of the source client. This lead to failures when calling GetObjectTags
        and unnecessary region redirect requests for HeadObject when using an opt-in
        region (e.g. af-south-1) that did not match the region of the source bucket.\r\n\r\n**Before
        this change:**\r\nIf you tried to copy an an individual file that required
        multipart copy across opt-in regions, you would get an error when the CLI
        went to describe the object tags it needs to copy over:\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3
        cp s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/10MB-tagged s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/  --source-region
        us-west-2 --region af-south-1\r\ncopy failed: s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/10MB-tagged
        to s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/10MB-tagged An error occurred (IllegalLocationConstraintException)
        when calling the GetObjectTagging operation: The us-west-2 location constraint
        is incompatible for the region specific endpoint this request was sent to.\r\n```\r\nIf
        you did the same transfer recursively, it would succeed but require additional
        HTTP (3 extra hops) to handle region redirects:\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3 cp s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/
        s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/ --recursive --source-region us-west-2
        --region af-south-1\r\ncopy: s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/10MB-tagged
        to s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/10MB-tagged\r\n$ aws history show
        | grep ''HTTP request sent'' | wc -l\r\n      10\r\n```\r\n**Note:** Region
        redirects did not save the non-recursive command because the initial head
        object was sent to the correct region to start and the subsequent API call
        was a `GetObjectTagging` call which does not support region redirects for
        opt-in regions.\r\n\r\n**With this change:**\r\nThe non-recursive copy succeeds:\r\n```\r\n$
        aws s3 cp s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/10MB-tagged s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/  --source-region
        us-west-2 --region af-south-1\r\ncopy: s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/10MB-tagged
        to s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/10MB-tagged\r\n$ aws s3api get-object-tagging
        --bucket kyleknap-af-south-1 --key some-prefix/10MB-tagged --region af-south-1\r\n{\r\n    \"TagSet\":
        [\r\n        {\r\n            \"Key\": \"tag\",\r\n            \"Value\":
        \"value\"\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\nThe expected number of HTTP
        requests are made for a recursive copy:\r\n```\r\n$ aws s3 cp s3://knapp-us-west-2/some-prefix/
        s3://kyleknap-af-south-1/some-prefix/ --recursive --source-region us-west-2
        --region af-south-1\r\n$ aws history show | grep ''HTTP request sent'' | wc
        -l\r\n       7\r\n```\r\nspecifically the seven calls are:\r\n* 1 ListObjectsV2
        call\r\n* 1 HeadObject call\r\n* 1 GetObjectTagging call\r\n* 1 CreateMPU
        call\r\n* 2 UploadPartCopy calls\r\n* 1 CompleteMPU API call\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7316/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7316/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1.0},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7315","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7315/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7315/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/aws/aws-cli/issues/7315/events","html_url":"https://github.com/aws/aws-cli/pull/7315","id":1392887276,"node_id":"PR_kwDOAGd3X84_9lYE","number":7315,"title":"[v2]
